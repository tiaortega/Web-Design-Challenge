# Web-Design-Challenge
 Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)
## The Start ##
1) Created a new repository called Web-Design_Challenge.
2) Cloned new repository to my computer.
3) Created a folder inside the repository called, WebVisualizations.
4) Added all html files, assets, resources, and visualizations to the WebVisualizations folder.
5) Pushed all work to GitHub.

## Purpose##

This assignment involved me creating a visualization dashboard website. I used visualizations
that was created previously in a past assignment. I also included plotted weather data. I created
individual pages for each plot that will involve navigation between them.  These pages will 
consist of a landing page, a comparison page( which will contain 4 separate pages with 
visualizations and corresponding explanations), and a data page.
